# Rolling Updates with ReplicaSets

Performing Updates Without Downtime

In this lesson, we will explore the concept of rolling updates with ReplicaSets, which allow you to update your applications seamlessly without causing downtime.

## What Are Rolling Updates?
Rolling updates are a deployment strategy that involves gradually replacing old versions of an application with new ones. This ensures that your application remains available and responsive during the update process.

## How Rolling Updates Work
Rolling updates with ReplicaSets work as follows:

New Pods with the updated application version are created.

Old Pods are gradually terminated in a controlled manner.

The number of Pods is maintained as specified, ensuring no downtime.

## Benefits of Rolling Updates

Rolling updates offer several advantages:

Zero Downtime: Users continue to access the application without interruptions.
Controlled Rollout: The update process can be monitored and controlled.
Easy Rollback: If issues arise, you can easily rollback to the previous version.
Lesson 2: Rollback Strategies
In this section, we will explore strategies for rolling back updates in case of issues or unexpected behavior.

## Why Rollback Strategies Are Important
While updates are typically planned and tested, issues can still occur. Rollback strategies are essential for mitigating risks and ensuring application stability.

## Performing a Rollback
To perform a rollback with ReplicaSets, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the issue or reason for the rollback.
1. Rollback by updating the ReplicaSet's template with the previous version of your application. Kubernetes will automatically start creating new Pods with the previous version and terminating the updated Pods.
